# spec

- **Name:** api_gemini
- **Version:** 0.8
- **Date:** 2025-11-08
- **Status:** Production Ready - All Features Complete + Enterprise Extensions
- **System Specification:** [../../spec.md](../../spec.md)

---
### 1. Project Goal

To create a high-quality, ergonomic, and idiomatic Rust client library for interacting with the Google Gemini API. The library provides comprehensive functionality for content generation, embeddings, and model management with robust error handling and diagnostic capabilities.

**Architecture Decision**: This API crate is designed as a **process-stateless HTTP client** with no persistence requirements. All operations are direct HTTP calls to the Gemini API without persistent storage. Runtime state (in-memory caches, metrics, connection pools) is encouraged for production features, but dies with the process.

**Governing Principle**: **"Thin Client, Rich API"** - Expose all server-side functionality transparently while maintaining zero client-side intelligence or automatic behaviors.

**Key Distinctions**:
- **No Automatic Behaviors**: Prohibits hidden decision-making and magic thresholds
- **No Process-Persistent State**: Prohibits file storage, databases, and cross-process state
- **Runtime State Allowed**: In-memory operational state (caches, metrics, counters) is encouraged
- **Explicit Configuration**: All enterprise features require explicit developer control

The client is a transparent window to the Gemini API with optional runtime enhancements, not a smart assistant that makes decisions for developers.

**Note:** This specification must be implemented in accordance with the ecosystem-wide requirements defined in the [System Specification](../../spec.md).

### Vocabulary

### Current Implementation Status

**✅ ALL FEATURES PRODUCTION READY**: Complete Gemini API functionality is fully implemented and operational with real API calls. 419 nextest integration tests + 103 doctests providing comprehensive coverage. All reliability, enterprise, and advanced features fully implemented including quota management, compression, model comparison, request templates, and buffered streaming.

**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES**: Some modules (workspaces, semantic retrieval) have complete structure but return mock data - awaiting Gemini API endpoint availability.

### 2. Critical Technical Discoveries

#### 2.1 Gemini Streaming API Format (Discovered 2025-10-12)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Gemini's `:streamGenerateContent` endpoint uses a JSON array format, NOT Server-Sent Events (SSE) or newline-delimited JSON.

**Actual Response Format:**
```json
[
  {"candidates": [...], "usageMetadata": {...}},
  {"candidates": [...], "usageMetadata": {...}, "finishReason": "STOP"}
]
```

**What It's NOT:**
- ❌ NOT SSE: `data: {...}\n\ndata: {...}\n\n`
- ❌ NOT NDJSON: `{...}\n{...}\n`
- ❌ NOT chunked JSON: Individual JSON objects sent separately

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. Buffer complete HTTP response body before parsing
2. Parse as `Vec<GenerateContentResponse>` using serde_json
3. Convert buffered array into async stream using `async-stream` crate
4. Use `Accept: application/json` header, NOT `Accept: text/event-stream`

**Historical Context:**
- Initial implementation incorrectly used `eventsource-stream` crate expecting SSE format
- This caused zero chunks to be parsed (all rejected as invalid SSE events)
- Fixed by switching to complete-buffering + JSON array deserialization approach
- See `tests/comprehensive_integration_tests.rs` for detailed test documentation
- See `src/models/api.rs:process_streaming_response()` for implementation details

**Dependencies:**
- `async-stream`: Required for `stream!` macro to emit array elements as chunks
- NOT `eventsource-stream`: Gemini doesn't use SSE format

**Performance Trade-off:**
- ⚠️ Must wait for complete response before emitting first chunk
- ⚠️ Higher memory usage for full response buffer
- ✅ Simple, robust implementation matching actual API behavior
- ✅ Fast response times (<1 second typical) make buffering acceptable

- ⚠️ Returns mock data with hardcoded timestamps and user IDs
- ⚠️ Caching mechanisms fully implemented and tested
- ⚠️ **Blocked on**: Gemini adding Workspaces API endpoint
- ✅ **Benefit**: Architecture ready when endpoint becomes available

**Semantic Retrieval API (Partial - Experimental)**
- ⚠️ Index creation, document indexing return mock data
- ⚠️ Embedding generation partially implemented
- ⚠️ Search functionality has basic structure
- ⚠️ **Blocked on**: Verification of Gemini semantic search endpoints

**Batch Operations (Stub - Awaiting Gemini API)**
- ⚠️ `batch_generate_content()` - Structure only

### 9. Testing Strategy (Implemented)

### 9.1. Testing Philosophy

**🚫 NO MOCKUP TESTS POLICY**: This crate follows a **strict no-mockup policy** for all testing:

- **Real Integration Tests Only**: All API functionality is tested against the actual Gemini API
- **No Mock Servers**: Tests use real HTTP calls to Google's production endpoints
- **No Mock Objects**: No synthetic test doubles or stub implementations
- **No Test Ignoring**: Tests are never marked with `#[ignore]` or conditionally skipped
- **No Silent Skipping**: Tests NEVER silently skip when API keys are unavailable
- **Missing API Key = Test Failure**: When `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unavailable, tests MUST fail explicitly with clear error messages (not skip, not pass)
- **Explicit Failures Only**: All authentication errors and missing keys result in test failures, never graceful skips
- **Confidence in Reality**: Tests validate actual production behavior, not simulated responses

**Rationale**: Mockups hide integration failures, API changes, and real-world edge cases. Real API tests provide confidence that the client works in production environments. Silent skipping masks configuration problems and gives false confidence in CI/CD pipelines.

### 9.2. Test Suite Composition
- **Total Tests**: 522 tests (419 nextest integration tests + 103 doctests)
- **Integration Tests**: 28 real API endpoint tests (enabled by default, require API key)
- **Unit Tests**: 23+ component isolation tests for implemented features (builder patterns, error handling, internal logic only)
- **Feature-Gated Tests**: Extensive tests for retry, streaming, builder patterns, and advanced features
- **Enterprise Tests** (v0.8): Quota management (16), model comparison (8), request templates (8), buffered streaming (5)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 228+ additional tests covering failure scenarios, edge cases, and performance
- **Test Categories**: Core API (models, content generation, embeddings), advanced features (retry, streaming, chat), error handling, enterprise features

### 9.3. Test Categories

```

### 9.4. Integration Testing Requirements (Updated 2025-10-01)

**✅ Strict Policy: Integration tests FAIL when API keys are unavailable**

- **API Key Loading via workspace_tools**: Tests use `Client::new()` which loads API keys in this order:
  1. Workspace secrets file: `secret/-secrets.sh` (using workspace_tools 0.6.0)
  2. Environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY`

- **Important Note**: workspace_tools 0.6.0 uses `secret/` (visible directory, NO dot prefix).

- **Explicit Failure with Detailed Paths**: Integration tests FAIL EXPLICITLY with comprehensive error messages showing:
  - Workspace secrets path tried (`secret/-secrets.sh`)
  - Specific error from workspace_tools (e.g., "key not found or file unreadable")
  - Environment variable status (e.g., "not set or empty")
  - Setup instructions with exact commands to fix the issue

- **Secret Loading via workspace_tools**: Uses workspace_tools 0.6.0 to properly locate and load secrets from workspace root's `secret/` directory following the [Secret Directory Policy](../../secret_directory_policy.md)

- **No Silent Skipping**: Tests NEVER skip silently - missing API keys result in test failures with detailed path information

- **No Graceful Skips**: Tests do NOT gracefully skip when authentication fails - they FAIL with explicit error messages listing all attempted paths

- **Test Failures Are Intentional**: Missing API key failures are correct behavior - they prevent false confidence in CI/CD by showing exactly what paths were tried

- **Default Behavior**: `cargo test` runs integration tests by default (enabled via `default = ["integration"]`)

- **Skip Integration**: Use `cargo test --no-default-features` to run only unit tests (when API key is intentionally unavailable)

- **CI/CD Strategy**: Build pipelines must either provide API keys or use `--no-default-features` to skip integration tests explicitly

### 10. Security Considerations (Implemented)

### 10.1. API Key Management
- ✅ Secure loading from workspace secrets
- ✅ Environment variable fallback
- ✅ No key exposure in logs or error messages
- ✅ Placeholder generation for debugging

### 10.2. Error Information Security
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages
- ✅ Safe serialization patterns
- ✅ Request debugging without key exposure

### 11. Developer Experience

### 11.1. Quick Start (Working)
```rust
use api_gemini::{Client, models::*};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = Client::new()?;
    
    let request = GenerateContentRequest {
        contents: vec![Content {
            parts: vec![Part {
                text: Some("Hello, Gemini!".to_string()),
                ..Default::default()
            }],
            role: "user".to_string(),
        }],
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let response = client
        .models()
        .by_name("gemini-2.5-flash")
        .generate_content(&request)
        .await?;

    println!("{:?}", response);
    Ok(())
}
```

### 11.2. Diagnostics Support (Working)
```rust
use api_gemini::{diagnostics::AsCurl, models::*};

let request = GenerateContentRequest { /* ... */ };
let curl_command = request.as_curl();
println!("Debug with: {}", curl_command);
```

- ✅ **Missing Documentation**: Created 4 mandatory readme.md files (src/error/, src/internal/, src/models/, api/)
- ✅ **Files Structure Compliance**: Resolved critical documentation violations per files_structure.rulebook.md

**✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-18) - Major Refactoring Complete:**
- ✅ **All monolithic files successfully refactored** (22,905 lines → modular structure):
  - `src/client.rs`: 5,090 lines → `src/client/` (6 modules: api_interfaces, builder, config, core, mod, sync)
  - `src/models/config.rs`: 3,135 lines → `src/models/config/` (modular structure, largest: mod.rs 949 lines)
  - `src/models/api.rs`: 2,962 lines → `src/models/api/` (content_generation, embeddings, models, mod)
  - `src/models/mod.rs`: 2,119 lines → Reorganized to 199 lines (90% reduction!)
  - `src/models/model_deployment.rs`: 1,901 lines → `src/models/model_deployment/` (modules)
  - `src/internal/http.rs`: 1,476 lines → `src/internal/http/` (modular structure)
  - `src/models/streaming_control.rs`: 1,341 lines → `src/models/streaming_control/` (modules)
  - `src/validation.rs`: 1,236 lines → Domain-based validation modules

  - `src/models/media_optimization.rs`: 1,051 lines → `src/models/media_optimization/` (modules)
- ✅ **Quality validation**: All tests pass (294 nextest + 90 doctests), zero clippy warnings
- ✅ **Compilation verified**: Strict mode (RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings") compilation successful
- 🟡 **Remaining large modules**: Some refactored modules still exceed 1000 lines (client/api_interfaces.rs: 2,181 lines, client/core.rs: 1,148 lines, models/api/content_generation.rs: 1,132 lines) - candidates for future sub-modularization if needed

**⚠️ ACTIVE - Other Technical Debt:**
- ⚠️ **Task Markers**: 37 TODO comments need conversion to xxx:/qqq: format (13 already proper format)
- 🚧 **Performance Benchmarks**: benches/ directory empty, need baseline measurements to validate <50ms overhead claim
- ⚠️ **General Request Caching**: Domain-specific caches exist (Workspaces, Semantic, Media), general HTTP caching incomplete

**📄 Documentation:**
- ✅ **Refactoring Plan**: See `docs/refactoring_plan.md` for comprehensive phased approach
- ✅ **Compliance Audit**: Files structure and codebase hygiene audit completed (2025-10-11)
- ✅ **Module Documentation**: All directories now have mandatory readme.md files

### 14.2. Excluded by Design (Architecture Incompatible)
